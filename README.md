Cloud component of Among Us In Real Life, a for-funsies PHP-based web app that allows a group of players to simulate various Among Us gameplay elements (tasks, sabotages, killing, etc.) with software. This project was made specifically to be work with most PHP hosting providers' free tiers (which often limit resource usage and do not give users an onboard DBMS). All you have to do is place all of the files into / and access /__panel.php to start configuring the game.
